boot_vehicles
<br><br>
When a player connects to the server and no one else is on, this script triggers spawning in vehicles from the sh_pos.txt to add immersion to the enviorment.
<br><br>
FiveM does not keep track of entities thus the script runs every time a player connects and they are the only one on.
<br><br>
For Commands to work, you must be inside a vehicle.
<br><br>
Commands:
<br>
gvpos - print current vehicle Model, X, Y, Z, and Heading
<br>
gvposa - append vehicle to sh_pos.txt located in the same directory as the server.cfg.
<br>
gvpos_trigger - trigger the vehicles to spawn manually.
